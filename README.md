## Deliverable 1
Based on the summary output we have come to the conclusion that the intercept, vehicle_length and groud_clearance where statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model and thus have the largest impact on MPG. Vehicle weight only slightly showed signs of randomness and thus does impact the variable of MPG. Spoiler_angle and whether it was AWD driver or not didn't impact MPG. 

When we look at the Multiple R Squared -Value and the significance level of the P -Value we noptice there is a strong linear realtionship with our data.

Even with the strong linear relationship in our data I still don't believe it is a good predictor of MPG. We would need to do further analysis on variables independently.
